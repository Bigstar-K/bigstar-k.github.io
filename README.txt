# Daesung Kim Portfolio (GitHub Pages)
This is a ready-to-upload static website.

## How to publish (GitHub Pages)
1) Create a repo named: `YOURNAME.github.io` (example: `bigstar-k.github.io`)
2) Upload all files from this folder to the repo root.
3) In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main / (root)
4) Wait a minute, then open: https://YOURNAME.github.io

## Notes
- Images are NOT included locally. Each project page hotlinks images from your Wix site.
- The gallery auto-extracts images by fetching your Wix page through a proxy (`r.jina.ai`) to avoid CORS.
